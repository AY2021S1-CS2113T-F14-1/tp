# Varsha - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
I am part of a team of 4 software engineering students and we were tasked to design and implement a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application for our team project. 
Our application is called CCA Manager. 
I was tasked with the Event Feature for our program.

### About the project
CCA Manager is a revolutionary all-in-one management tool that changes the way 
you can manage interest groups with unrivaled efficiency and simplicity. It has 3 features 
in total, HR, Finance and Events.

### Summary of Contributions
This section shows a brief summary of my contributions to the team project, including coding, documenting and other helpful contributions throughout the development of CCA Manager.

that I have contributed in this project.

#### Features Added

I added to the event feature in this project. Specifically  `CommandEventAdd`, `CommandEventDel`, `CommandEventList`  ,`CommandEventStatus`, `CommandSearchEvent` and `CommandEventCountdown`

The user will be able to use `event addEvent` to add a new event to the list.   <br/>
The user may also use `event delEvent <index>` or `event delEvent all` command to delete an existing event or all events in the list. <br/>
To mark an event as completed, user can use `event done <index>` <br/>
The user can use `event listEvent` to list all the events in the list. <br/>
The user can use `event search` to find events. They have the option to:
 - Search by Event date <br/>
 - Search by Event name <br/>
The user can use   `event countdown` to see number of days left to the upcoming event. <br/>

**Enhancements Added:**
* User will not be able add an event that matches in name and date with an existing event.
* User will be able to search by both date and name

Justification: Event feature is designed to keep track of all the events that a CCA/interest group may organise or attend. 
For example, with the countdown feature, they will be aware of the number of days left to the event and will not lose track of time.
